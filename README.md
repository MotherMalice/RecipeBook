RecipeBook was made in 5 days as a take home assignment for an interview process, I was allowed to build whatever I wanted to as long as it used:
DJango for the API
React.js for the Front-End
Deployed to AWS

Going forward any changes made are for the sake of making a nicer more complete project for portfolio reasons, however this initial commit
and the readme commit are at the end of the 5 day sprint.
